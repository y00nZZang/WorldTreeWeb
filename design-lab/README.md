# Design Lab

This directory contains experimental design work and Figma-generated components for the WorldTreeWeb project.

## Purpose

The Design Lab is a workspace for:
- Experimenting with UI/UX designs
- Storing Figma-generated design components
- Prototyping screen layouts
- Collecting design assets

## Structure

```
design-lab/
├── components/     # Figma-generated component designs
├── screens/        # Screen layout prototypes
└── assets/         # Design assets (icons, images, mockups)
```

## Workflow

1. Export designs from Figma
2. Place component designs in `components/`
3. Place screen layouts in `screens/`
4. Reference these designs when implementing actual React components

## Notes

- This directory is separate from the actual codebase (`frontend/`, `backend/`)
- Files here are for reference and experimentation only
- Actual implementation should be done in the `frontend/` package
